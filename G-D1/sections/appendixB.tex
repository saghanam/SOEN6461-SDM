    \item Mansi: Do you find the TVM user friendly to get all the information you need to purchase a ticket/membership?

    \newline Pal: You can create a demo video to use the system in case of people who are unfamiliar with systems like TVM

    \newline Pal: 8

    \newline Pal: Yes that would be a great option to have so that prebooking can help a lot in bixiâ€™s availability.

    \newline Pal: No I use Bixi on monthly basis some months I do use it some months I skip so monthly membership works for me
