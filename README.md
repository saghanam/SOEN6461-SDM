TVM 
A Ticket Vending Machine (TVM), also known as a ticket machine or a ticketing kiosk,
is an automated, self-service, vending machine that produces tickets for some means of
public transportation. (There are TVMs for other purposes, but the attention here is on
public transportation only.)
The purpose of the project is to create a set of interrelated artifacts for the problem as
well as the solution domain of the software aspect of a maintainable, secure,
(environmentally) sustainable, and usable TVM. In the rest of the document, ‘iGo’ stands
for the name of both the project and the product, unless otherwise stated.
iGo is an object-oriented software engineering project, involving certain elements of
both agile methodologies and rigid methodologies. It involves individual work as well
as communal work.
The work on iGo has been divided into a collection of interrelated problems to be
solved. Each problem is accompanied by a note, meant to serve as a guide for scoping,
understanding, and/or solving the problem. The problems have been grouped into a
collection of deliverables. 

WORK DONE FOR DELIVERABLE 1
The TVM chosen as iGo here is the bixi bike system of Montreal. 
This contains a latex files with all the problems for deliverable 1 and the interview recordings.
